/**
 * This is an "AI Service". It is a Java service with AI capabilities/features.
 * It can be integrated into your code like any other service, acting as a bean, and can be mocked for testing.
 * The goal is to seamlessly integrate AI functionality into your (existing) codebase with minimal friction.
 * It's conceptually similar to Spring Data JPA or Retrofit.
 * You define an interface and optionally customize it with annotations.
 * LangChain4j then provides an implementation for this interface using proxy and reflection.
 * This approach abstracts away all the complexity and boilerplate.
 * So you won't need to juggle the model, messages, memory, RAG components, tools, output parsers, etc.
 * However, don't worry. It's quite flexible and configurable, so you'll be able to tailor it
 * to your specific use case.
